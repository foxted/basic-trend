# CONTRIBUTING

## Process

1. Discuss the issue with the community first
2. Fork the repository and submit a pull request

## Notes

- Add unit tests for any bug fixes or feature change
- Update README when necessary
- Do not bump version yourself
- We use [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) as a commit convention
